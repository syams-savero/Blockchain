Features of Smart Contracts

Smart contracts have several features that set them apart from traditional agreements:

-Decentralization – Operate on the blockchain without central intermediaries, maintained by thousands of node operators.
-Transparency & Flexibility – All activities are visible on-chain, with pseudo-anonymity ensuring privacy.
-Speed & Efficiency – Transactions are much faster compared to traditional banking systems, including international transfers.
-Security & Immutability – Once deployed, contracts cannot be altered; blockchain data is distributed and resilient.
-Elimination of Counterparty Risk – Agreements are enforced automatically, removing the risk of one party not fulfilling obligations.


Applications of Smart Contracts

-DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) – Organizations run entirely by code with transparent governance.
-NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) – Unique digital assets enabling new opportunities for creators.
