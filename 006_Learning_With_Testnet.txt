Learning With testnet

What is a Testnet?
A testnet is a blockchain testing network that allows you to try out transactions and smart contracts without using real money.

Why Use a Testnet?
Practice sending transactions and understanding gas.
Experiment safely without risking real assets.

Popular Example:
Sepolia, with its own explorer: sepolia.etherscan.io

Faucets:
To use a testnet, you need test tokens (e.g., test ETH). These are free and can be obtained from faucets, such as faucets.chain.link

How to Use a Faucet (Example: Sepolia):
Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the faucet.
Select the Sepolia network.
Request test ETH (some faucets may require a Twitter login or another account).
The test ETH will appear in your wallet balance.

Viewing Transactions:
Every transaction generates a transaction hash, which can be checked in an explorer like Sepolia Etherscan. Key details include:
Hash (unique transaction ID)
Status (success/failure)
From (sender address)
To (receiver address)
Value (amount of test ETH sent)

Important Notes:
Testnet ETH has no real monetary value.
Use it only for testing and learning.
Testnets evolve and may change over time.
