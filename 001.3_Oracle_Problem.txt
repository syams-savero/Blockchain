Blockchains are secure because they’re closed, deterministic systems. Smart contracts run inside this isolated world. The downside: they cannot access external, real-world data on their own. No APIs, no weather data, no price feeds.

But real applications need off-chain information:

– DeFi protocols need real-time prices.
– Insurance contracts need weather data.
– Prediction markets need game results.
– Supply chain systems need delivery confirmations.

Since blockchains can’t fetch external data, this becomes the Blockchain Oracle Problem.

Why not just use one oracle?
Because one centralized data source becomes a huge vulnerability. If it’s hacked, goes offline, or lies, the entire “trustless” contract suddenly depends on a single trusted party. That completely defeats decentralization.

Solution: Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs)
A DON is a network of independent oracle nodes. They all fetch the same data from multiple high-quality sources, compare results, reach consensus, and send the final verified value on-chain.

This removes single points of failure and makes the data reliable.

Hybrid Smart Contracts
Modern smart contracts combine on-chain logic with off-chain data and computation from a DON.
On-chain = secure, transparent code.
Off-chain = real-world data and extra computation.

Hybrid smart contracts unlock real use cases without sacrificing security.

Chainlink: The Industry Standard
Chainlink is the leading decentralized oracle network. It's blockchain-agnostic and offers essential services:

– Data Feeds: reliable market prices for DeFi.
– VRF: provably fair randomness for NFTs and games.
– Automation: decentralized task scheduling.
– Cross-Chain Messaging: communication between smart contracts across different blockchains.

Chainlink solves the oracle problem and lets smart contracts safely interact with the real world.
