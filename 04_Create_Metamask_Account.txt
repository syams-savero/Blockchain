How to Create a MetaMask Wallet (Browser Extension)
1. Install from the official site

Go to metamask.io
 → click Download → choose your browser (Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Firefox).
Add the extension from the official browser store. Make sure the publisher is MetaMask.

2. Open the extension → Get Started
After installation, click the MetaMask icon in your browser toolbar.
Choose “Create a new wallet” (or “Import” if you already have one).

3. Create a password
Set a strong password.
This password only locks/unlocks MetaMask on your device — it is not your recovery key.

4. Save your Secret Recovery Phrase (SRP)
MetaMask will show you a 12-word Secret Recovery Phrase.
Write it down on paper and store it offline.
Never share your SRP with anyone, never upload it to cloud storage. Whoever has it controls your wallet.

5. Confirm the SRP
MetaMask will ask you to confirm the words in the correct order.
Complete the confirmation → your wallet is ready to use.

Security Tips
Never share your SRP. MetaMask support or admins will never ask for it.
Always double-check you are on the official site (metamask.io) before entering any sensitive info.
If you change or lose your device, you can restore your wallet using the “Import with Secret Recovery Phrase” option.

After setup, you can:
Add tokens (click Import tokens if some don’t show up).
Add new networks (e.g., Polygon, BSC).
Connect a hardware wallet for extra security.
